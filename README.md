Note: You're currently browsing commits from the refactoring of the original ClangSharpTest2020 prototype. Things may be in a very broken state.

Biohazrd is a framework for creating binding generators for C **and** C++ libraries. It aims to lower the amount of ongoing boilerplate maintenance required to use native libraries from .NET as well as allow direct interoperation with C++ libraries without a C translation later.

Biohazrd is still under heavy development, documentation and API stability are non-existent. If you're interested in this project, consider [sponsoring development](https://github.com/sponsors/PathogenDavid).
